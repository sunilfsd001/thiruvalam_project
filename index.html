  <section>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Thiruvalam (often spelled Thiruvallam) is an historic settlement in the Vellore district, Tamil Nadu, which grew around the
      Vilwanatheswarar (Vilvanatheswarar) Temple — a Shiva shrine revered in early Tamil Saiva literature. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Early history and inscriptions</h2>
    <p>
      The temple site and the town show evidence of antiquity: the Vilwanatheswarar shrine is mentioned in the Tevaram (7th century),
      and the temple complex contains inscriptions and architectural features from Pallava and Chola periods. Over centuries the
      place-name appears in inscriptions and medieval Tamil works under slightly different forms (examples include names recorded
      during Nandivarman’s era and later Chola inscriptions). :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Legends associated with the name</h2>
    <p class="legend">
      Local legend explains the name in connection with an episode about Lord Vinayaka (Ganesha) and his brother Muruga: when a contest
      to circle the world was held, Ganesha circumambulated his parents (Shiva and Parvati) and thereby was said to have “circled the
      world” (in Tamil, <strong>valam</strong> means to go around). The place that commemorates that act came to be called Thiru- + valam
      (sacred circumambulation place), ultimately Thiruvallam or Thiruvalam. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Temple architecture & important features</h2>
    <p>
      The Vilwanatheswarar Temple features typical Dravidian temple elements: a gopuram (multi-tiered gateway), inner sanctum with the
      Shiva lingam, and several subsidiary shrines. Nandi (the bull) has a prominent place outside the main shrine and is part of the
      temple’s local legends (e.g., Nandi protecting a priest from a demon). The temple complex has been renovated and patronized across
      several dynasties (Pallava, Chola, later local rulers), leaving a layered architectural and epigraphical record. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Religious importance</h2>
    <p>
      Thiruvalam is one of the Paadal Petra Sthalams — Shiva temples praised in the Tevaram hymns by Tamil Saiva saints — and thus
      holds an important place in Tamil Shaivite devotional geography. The site is also mentioned in the hymns and traditions of later
      Tamil saints like Arunagirinathar. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Local traditions & festivals</h2>
    <p>
      The temple remains an active religious centre with regular daily worship and annual festival celebrations. Certain local stories
      (such as the demon Kanja episode and Nandi’s guarding role) are part of the temple’s living tradition and shape festival narratives. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Visiting today</h2>
    <p>
      The shrine is managed locally and is open to visitors; it is often visited by pilgrims and by people exploring the temple heritage
      of the Vellore–Ranipet region. For timings, local administration or the temple board (state HR & CE in Tamil Nadu) lists practical
      visitor information. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
